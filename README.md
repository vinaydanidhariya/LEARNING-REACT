# Learning React

This repository contains my first React application where I have implemented the following topics:

- Class Component
- Function Component
- Hooks
- State
- useState
- useEffect
- API Calls
- Bootstrap Integration
- Theme Integration

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Demo

You can check out the live demo of the application at the following link:

[DEMO LINK](https://vinaydanidhariya.github.io/LEARNING-REACT/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
